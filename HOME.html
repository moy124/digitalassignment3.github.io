      <h3>WHAT IS SQL?</h3>
      <p>SQL stands for structured query language.We also refer it as 'SEQUEL'. <br>
         SQL is a databasse specific programing language - meaning it can be used with database. <br>
         Well, it’s a popular type of database known as a relational database. <br>
         <strong>What’s a relational database?</strong> <br> A relational database is a set of multiple data sets organised by tables, records and columns. <br>
         Each table is known as a relation. <br>
         Here’s a diagram which explains the concept:   <br>

         Data is stored in tables. similar to excell sheets<br>
         In a relational database these tables can communicate with each other based on specific fields in the database <br>
         SQL is the language used to create, retrieve, update and delete data from a database. <br>   
         For communicating with database SQL is broken into DDL and DML<br>

      <h2>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DDL AND DML:</h2>
      <p>Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) together forms a Database Language. <br> 
        The basic difference between DDL and DML is that DDL (Data Definition Language) is used to Specify the database schema database structure. <br>

        On the other hand, DML (Data Manipulation Language) is used to access, modify or retrieve the data from the database. <br>
        Let us discuss the differences between DDL and DML, with the help of comparison chart shown below. <br> <br></p>

      <h2>DDL COMMANDS</h2>
      <p>
        DDL or Data Definition Language actually consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define the database schema.  <br>
        It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and modify the structure of database objects in the database. <br>
        DDL COMMANDS ARE: <br>
        1)CREATE <br>
        2)ALTER <br>
        3)DROP <br>
        4)TRUNCATE <br>
        5)COMMENT <br>
        6)RENAME <br>

      <h2>DML COMMANDS</h2>
      <p>DML stands for DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE. The SQL commands that deals with the manipulation of data present in the <br> database belong to 
        DML or Data Manipulation Language and this includes most of the SQL statements.<br>
        DML COMMANDS ARE: <br>
        1)SELECT <br>
        2)INSERT <br>
        3)UPDATE <br>
        4)DELETE <br>
